(1) For loop till queue.size() only when you need to print nodes level-by-level (leetcode specific)
(2) For rest BFS traversals, simply take out front node from queue, and insert left and right childs in queue (within while loop)
(3) For some BFS traversals, simply insert nodes of any level and insert NULL in Queue at the last iteration. Play with NULL
