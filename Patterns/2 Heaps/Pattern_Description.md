# Descripton
This pattern is more often used in **finding Median related problems**, where we can divide the given numbers into 2 parts. One part in increamental order and other part with decremental order.
In this way, we have the smallest element in one part (at the top) and biggest element in other part (at the top), and we can fetch the median in O(1) time complexity

Data Structure:
Two heap data structure is used to solve these problems: 
- A Min heap to find the smalled element 
- A Max heap to find the biggest element


Questions:
- Find Median from Data Stream [Hard]
- Sliding Window Median [Hard]
- Sliding Window Maximum [Hard]
