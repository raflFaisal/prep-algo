# prep-algo
This project aims to guide individual preparing for software development interviews (targeting FAANG companies and others)

# How to prepare
As you guys are aware that preapring for FAANG companies is a huge task which requires lots of efforts, time and patience. There is a long list of coding questions which could be asked in the interviews. Mostly people are try to solve as many questions as possible and just memorise the solutions, as a result the outcome is negative in most cases.

Reasons for not clearing interviews:
- When known question is faced, some people simply forget the solutions, or part of the solution 
- Unseen question before => stuck, due of low confidence in solving unseen questions
- other simillar reasons


Interviewer basically wants to check your approach in solving questions, your way of thinking to solve a given problem. And the best way is to practice intelligently and not just memorising each and every problem and their solutions. 

The intelligent way is to practice with *Patterns* based on specific algorithms to solve problems. In this way, for any specific pattern, you can solve small set of questions instead of solving a long list of questions based on same pattern. e.g. there are many questions which are solved using "Binary Search Tree" algorithm, so you can practice solving some questions based on BST, and for many other simillar questions your mind will automatically pick-up BST algorithm to solve these unsolved questions. In this way, you can prepare for interviews in a fast and efficient manner without the risk of facing embarrasment situation (such as memory-loss for any memorised question), and you are well prepared for unseen questions during interviews.

Note that In this repo, you will find small set of questions against each pattern. The purpose of this repository is to share information related to patterns (and not long list of questions against each patterns)
